	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>I am Jayden Russell, a 14 year old who aspires to work in game development. I'm from Lancaster, California, and have always liked the desert. I have always wanted to make games on Roblox and have admired developers like Epic Games, Sony, and etc. I am an avid anime fan, my favorite being Dragon Ball Z, and I like to cook. Given proper direction, I can cook anything you throw at me! I can play both the guitar and the trombone (to an extent), and have the ability to play anything that I hear. I really love gaming as a whole, and my favorite all time stuff is going to be listed below in the form of Top 5s. If I were to summarize myself, I would say that I'm pretty laid back, and match people's energy to the best of my ability.</p>
